# Spotify Clone App README

## Overview

This is a **Spotify Clone** application designed to replicate the core features of Spotify, such as music streaming, playlist management, and user interaction with music content. The app allows users to explore and listen to a wide variety of songs, albums, and playlists, just like the original Spotify app. This project aims to create a user-friendly, functional music streaming platform.

- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login
- **APIs:** Custom-built API to fetch music data (or you can integrate Spotifyâ€™s public API)
- **Music Player:** HTML5 audio player with custom controls
- **Deployment:** Heroku, Netlify, or any cloud service for hosting

## Features

- **User Authentication:**
  - Sign up and login with email/password or through third-party OAuth (Google/Facebook login).

  - Follow other users and artists for updates.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - Fully responsive on both mobile and desktop platforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (for backend)
- **npm/yarn** (for managing packages)
- **MongoDB** (or any other preferred database)
- **React.js** (for frontend)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spotify-clone.git
   cd spotify-clone
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   - For the **frontend**:

     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

   - For the **backend**:

     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```

3. **Setup environment variables:**

   Create `.env` files for both the frontend and backend with the following variables (update with your values):

   - **Backend `.env`** (inside `server` folder):
     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
     PORT=5000
     ```

   - **Frontend `.env`** (inside `client` folder):
     ```env
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     ```

4. **Start the server and client:**

   - Start the **backend server**:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```

   - Start the **frontend app**:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

   Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Features in Progress (Future Enhancements)

- **Offline Listening**: Allow users to download music and listen offline.
- **User Profiles**: Add user profile pages with their listening history and playlists.
- **Recommendations**: Implement a recommendation engine based on user behavior.
- **Subscription Plans**: Integrate subscription-based services (Premium-like features).
- **Admin Panel**: Admin panel for managing users, content, and app settings.
